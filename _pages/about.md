Hi! My name is Javier Hern√°ndez. I studied for a Bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Seville. I am currently working as a full-stack developer at a company called Soleta. One of my favorite languages (and also one of the first ones I learned IIRC) is Rust. It has a nice and consolidated community, and probably was one of the major factors for my love to free and open source software development. This is my personal portfolio, where I will be showing the projects I am working on during my free time.

This is my personal blog too, where I will be writing posts whenever I find the time. I write mostly about events going on in the tech world (i.e movements in free software communities, new exploits discovered, new technologies that gets released, etc.). Additionally, I like writing tutorials and sharing the things I learn while doing my hobby projects with everyone that finds them interesting!

I won't limit this blog to only tech-related posts. For instance, I love cultural activities, so expect some reviews of the books I read and the movies I watch!
I also love writing about things happening in my life: activities I do, personal opinions about global events and, essentially, anything that catches my eyes in my environment.
